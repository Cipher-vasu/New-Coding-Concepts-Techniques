Backtracking algorithm is applied to some specific types of problems:-
1. Decision problem used to find a feasible solution of the problem.
2. Optimisation problem used to find the best solution that can be applied.
3. Enumeration problem used to find the set of all feasible solutions of the problem.

General Template for BackTracking Problems:-

void dfs(arguments) {
	if (condition == true) { // Condition when we should stop our exploration.
		result.push_back(current);
		return;
	}
	for (int i = num; i <= last; i++) {
		current.push_back(i); // Explore candidate.
		dfs(arguments);
		current.pop_back();   // Abandon candidate.
	}
}
