The Tabulation is exact opposite of recursion if in recursion we are going from 0 to n then in tabulation we will go from n to 0 and vice-versa.

Prefer starting recurrence from a fixed point if it is available like in unique paths both starting and ending points are fixed but in triangle starting point is fixed but ending point can vary.
